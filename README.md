# SW-MCU-STM32-Keypad-021

Here is simple code for an access system. You need to enter password to turn on the relay.

'*' is acts like enter key , and '#' is acts like delete key. Default password is 123A in the code.

There is also a capacitive touch button to control relay without password. 

This can be consider the button inside of the door.
